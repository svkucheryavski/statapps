# Interactive apps for learning statistics

A collection of interactive web applications, which can be used for teaching and learning applied statistics. The original version was made using R/Shiny but has been replaces with the current version written using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), so every app is just a JavaScript file, which can be embed into any HTML page and be used without any server.

You can see the full list and try any app [here]().

## How to use

If you want to use any app in your project, do the following. Here, for example, it is assumed that you selected app *b1001a*, which is the first app in the list.

1. Download `b1001a.js` and `b10001a.css` from the `b1001/build` folder.
2. Create a new HTML file (or use the one you already have).
3. In the header write the following:

```html

<head>
...
<script type="" src="">
</head>
```
